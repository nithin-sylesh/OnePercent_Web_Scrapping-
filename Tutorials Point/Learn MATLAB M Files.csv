M-File also called as the script file is a series of MATLAB commands that will get executed sequentially when the file is executed. This tutorial is designed to give students fluency in working on the M-files in MATLAB. Problem-based examples have also been given in simple and easy way to make your learning fast and effective|||This tutorial has been prepared for the beginners to help them understand basic to advanced functionality of MATLAB M-File. After completing this tutorial you will find yourself at a moderate level of expertise in using M-files from where you can take yourself to next levels. |||We assume you have a little knowledge of any computer programming and understand concepts like variables, constants, expression, statements, etc. If you have done programming in any other high-level programming language like C, C++ or Java, then it will be very much beneficial and learning MATLAB M-File will be like a fun for you.",,,,

These functions separate the variables from the workspace which you access at the MATLAB command prompt. This is called the base workspace.|||Functions can accept more than one input arguments and may return more than one output arguments.|||The syntax of a function statement is as follows −|||Here out1, out2...outN are output variables. It can be a single variable or comma separated. The variables in1, in2, in3...inN are input variables which can be single variable or comma separated ones. The function in MATLAB starts with the keyword function as shown in the syntax.|||While naming your m-file, you should take care that the file name and the function name has to match. You cannot use the name of any built-in function available in MATLAB.|||Let us now create a simple function and save it as .m file and run it.
