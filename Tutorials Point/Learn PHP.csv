This means that a reference to the variable is manipulated by the function rather than a copy of the variable's value.|||Any changes made to an argument in these cases will change the value of the original variable.

PHP transparently supports HTTP cookies.|||There are three steps involved in identifying returning users −|||Server script sends a set of cookies to the browser. For example name, age, or identification number etc.|||Browser stores this information on local machine for future use.|||When next time browser sends any request to web server then it sends those cookies information to the server and server uses that information to identify the user.|||This chapter will teach you how to set cookies, how to access them and how to delete them.|||Cookies are usually set in an HTTP header (although JavaScript can also set a cookie directly on a browser). A PHP script that sets a cookie might send headers that look something like this −|||As you can see, the Set-Cookie header contains a name value pair, a GMT date, a path and a domain. The name and value will be URL encoded. The expires field is an instruction to the browser to ""forget"" the cookie after the given time and date.|||If the browser is configured to store cookies, it will then keep this information until the expiry date. If the user points the browser at any page that matches the path and domain of the cookie, it will resend the cookie to the server.The browser's headers might look something like this −|||A PHP script will then have access to the cookie in the environmental variables $_COOKIE or $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS[] which holds all cookie names and values. Above cookie can be accessed using $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS[""name""].|||PHP provided setcookie() function to set a cookie. This function requires upto six arguments and should be called before <html> tag. For each cookie this function has to be called separately.|||Here is the detail of all the arguments −|||Name − This sets the name of the cookie and is stored in an environment variable called HTTP_COOKIE_VARS. This variable is used while accessing cookies.|||Value − This sets the value of the named variable and is the content that you actually want to store.|||Expiry − This specify a future time in seconds since 00:00:00 GMT on 1st Jan 1970. After this time cookie will become inaccessible. If this parameter is not set then cookie will automatically expire when the Web Browser is closed.|||Path − This specifies the directories for which the cookie is valid. A single forward slash character permits the cookie to be valid for all directories.|||Domain − This can be used to specify the domain name in very large domains and must contain at least two periods to be valid. All cookies are only valid for the host and domain which created them.|||Security − This can be set to 1 to specify that the cookie should only be sent by secure transmission using HTTPS otherwise set to 0 which mean cookie can be sent by regular HTTP.|||Following example will create two cookies name and age these cookies will be expired after one hour.|||PHP provides many ways to access cookies. Simplest way is to use either $_COOKIE or $HTTP_COOKIE_VARS variables. Following example will access all the cookies set in above example.|||You can use isset() function to check if a cookie is set or not.|||Officially, to delete a cookie you should call setcookie() with the name argument only but this does not always work well, however, and should not be relied on.|||It is safest to set the cookie with a date that has already expired −","Server script sends a set of cookies to the browser.

They provide the foundation for pattern-matching functionality.|||Using regular expression you can search a particular string inside a another string, you can replace one string by another string and you can split a string into many chunks.|||PHP offers functions specific to two sets of regular expression functions, each corresponding to a certain type of regular expression. You can use any of them based on your comfort.|||The structure of a POSIX regular expression is not dissimilar to that of a typical arithmetic expression: various elements (operators) are combined to form more complex expressions.|||The simplest regular expression is one that matches a single character, such as g, inside strings such as g, haggle, or bag.|||Lets give explanation for few concepts being used in POSIX regular expression. After that we will introduce you with regular expression related functions.|||Brackets ([]) have a special meaning when used in the context of regular expressions. They are used to find a range of characters.|||[0-9]|||It matches any decimal digit from 0 through 9.|||[a-z]|||It matches any character from lower-case a through lowercase z.|||[A-Z]|||It matches any character from uppercase A through uppercase Z.|||[a-Z]|||It matches any character from lowercase a through uppercase Z.|||The ranges shown above are general; you could also use the range [0-3] to match any decimal digit ranging from 0 through 3, or the range [b-v] to match any lowercase character ranging from b through v.|||The frequency or position of bracketed character sequences and single characters can be denoted by a special character. Each special character having a specific connotation. The +, *, ?, {int. range}, and $ flags all follow a character sequence.|||p+|||It matches any string containing at least one p.|||p*|||It matches any string containing zero or more p's.|||p?|||It matches any string containing zero or one p's.|||p{N}|||It matches any string containing a sequence of N p's|||p{2,3}|||It matches any string containing a sequence of two or three p's.|||p{2, }|||It matches any string containing a sequence of at least two p's.|||p$|||It matches any string with p at the end of it.|||^p|||It matches any string with p at the beginning of it.|||Following examples will clear your concepts about matching characters.|||[^a-zA-Z]|||It matches any string not containing any of the characters ranging from a through z and A through Z.|||p.p|||It matches any string containing p, followed by any character, in turn followed by another p.|||^.{2}$|||It matches any string containing exactly two characters.|||<b>(.*)</b>|||It matches any string enclosed within <b> and </b>.|||p(hp)*|||It matches any string containing a p followed by zero or more instances of the sequence php.|||For your programming convenience several predefined character ranges, also known as character classes, are available. Character classes specify an entire range of characters, for example, the alphabet or an integer set −|||[[:alpha:]]|||It matches any string containing alphabetic characters aA through zZ.|||[[:digit:]]|||It matches any string containing numerical digits 0 through 9.|||[[:alnum:]]|||It matches any string containing alphanumeric characters aA through zZ and 0 through 9.|||[[:space:]]|||It matches any string containing a space.|||PHP currently offers seven functions for searching strings using POSIX-style regular expressions −|||The ereg() function searches a string specified by string for a string specified by pattern, returning true if the pattern is found, and false otherwise.|||The ereg_replace() function searches for string specified by pattern and replaces pattern with replacement if found.|||The eregi() function searches throughout a string specified by pattern for a string specified by string. The search is not case sensitive.|||The eregi_replace() function operates exactly like ereg_replace(), except that the search for pattern in string is not case sensitive.|||The split() function will divide a string into various elements, the boundaries of each element based on the occurrence of pattern in string.|||The spliti() function operates exactly in the same manner as its sibling split(), except that it is not case sensitive.|||The sql_regcase() function can be thought of as a utility function, converting each character in the input parameter string into a bracketed expression containing two characters.|||Perl-style regular expressions are similar to their POSIX counterparts. The POSIX syntax can be used almost interchangeably with the Perl-style regular expression functions. In fact, you can use any of the quantifiers introduced in the previous POSIX section.|||Lets give explanation for few concepts being used in PERL regular expressions. After that we will introduce you wih regular expression related functions.|||A meta character is simply an alphabetical character preceded by a backslash that acts to give the combination a special meaning.|||For instance, you can search for large money sums using the '\d' meta character: /([\d]+)000/, Here \d will search for any string of numerical character.|||Following is the list of meta characters which can be used in PERL Style Regular Expressions.|||Several modifiers are available that can make your work with regexps much easier, like case sensitivity, searching in multiple lines etc.|||PHP offers following functions for searching strings using Perl-compatible regular expressions −|||The preg_match() function searches string for pattern, returning true if pattern exists, and false otherwise.|||The preg_match_all() function matches all occurrences of pattern in string.|||The preg_replace() function operates just like ereg_replace(), except that regular expressions can be used in the pattern and replacement input parameters.|||The preg_split() function operates exactly like split(), except that regular expressions are accepted as input parameters for pattern.|||The preg_grep() function searches all elements of input_array, returning all elements matching the regexp pattern.|||Quote regular expression characters",POSIX Regular Expressions@@@PERL Style Regular Expressions,,"Sr.No@@@Expression & Description|||1@@@[0-9]

An XML document is plain text and contains tags delimited by < and >.There are two big differences between XML and HTML −|||XML gives you a lot more freedom than HTML. HTML has a certain set of tags: the <a></a> tags surround a link, the <p> starts paragraph and so on. An XML document, however, can use any tags you want. Put <rating></rating> tags around a movie rating, <height></height> tags around someone's height. Thus XML gives you option to device your own tags.|||XML is very strict  when it comes to document structure. HTML lets you play fast and loose with some opening and closing tags. But this is not the case with XML.|||This is not a valid XML document because there are no closing </li> tags to match up with the three opening <li> tags.

You can think of a class as a template for making many instances of the same kind (or class) of object.|||Object − An individual instance of the data structure defined by a class. You define a class once and then make many objects that belong to it. Objects are also known as instance.|||Member Variable − These are the variables defined inside a class. This data will be invisible to the outside of the class and can be accessed via member functions. These variables are called attribute of the object once an object is created.|||Member function − These are the function defined inside a class and are used to access object data.|||Inheritance − When a class is defined by inheriting existing function of a parent class then it is called inheritance. Here child class will inherit all or few member functions and variables of a parent class.|||Parent class − A class that is inherited from by another class. This is also called a base class or super class.|||Child Class − A class that inherits from another class. This is also called a subclass or derived class.|||Polymorphism − This is an object oriented concept where same function can be used for different purposes. For example function name will remain same but it take different number of arguments and can do different task.|||Overloading − a type of polymorphism in which some or all of operators have different implementations depending on the types of their arguments. Similarly functions can also be overloaded with different implementation.|||Data Abstraction − Any representation of data in which the implementation details are hidden (abstracted).|||Encapsulation − refers to a concept where we encapsulate all the data and member functions together to form an object.|||Constructor − refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever there is an object formation from a class.|||Destructor − refers to a special type of function which will be called automatically whenever an object is deleted or goes out of scope.|||The general form for defining a new class in PHP is as follows −|||Here is the description of each line −|||The special form class, followed by the name of the class that you want to define.|||A set of braces enclosing any number of variable declarations and function definitions.|||Variable declarations start with the special form var, which is followed by a conventional $ variable name; they may also have an initial assignment to a constant value.|||Function definitions look much like standalone PHP functions but are local to the class and will be used to set and access object data.|||Here is an example which defines a class of Books type −|||The variable $this is a special variable and it refers to the same object ie. itself.|||Once you defined your class, then you can create as many objects as you like of that class type. Following is an example of how to create object using new operator.|||Here we have created three objects and these objects are independent of each other and they will have their existence separately. Next we will see how to access member function and process member variables.|||After creating your objects, you will be able to call member functions related to that object. One member function will be able to process member variable of related object only.|||Following example shows how to set title and prices for the three books by calling member functions.|||Now you call another member functions to get the values set by in above example −|||This will produce the following result −|||Constructor Functions are special type of functions which are called automatically whenever an object is created. So we take full advantage of this behaviour, by initializing many things through constructor functions. |||PHP provides a special function called __construct() to define a constructor. You can pass as many as arguments you like into the constructor function.|||Following example will create one constructor for Books class and it will initialize price and title for the book at the time of object creation.|||Now we don't need to call set function separately to set price and title. We can initialize these two member variables at the time of object creation only. Check following example below −|||This will produce the following result −|||Like a constructor function you can define a destructor function using function __destruct(). You can release all the resources with-in a destructor.|||PHP class definitions can optionally inherit from a parent class definition by using the extends clause. The syntax is as follows −|||The effect of inheritance is that the child class (or subclass or derived class) has the following characteristics −|||Automatically has all the member variable declarations of the parent class.|||Automatically has all the same member functions as the parent, which (by default) will work the same way as those functions do in the parent.|||Following example inherit Books class and adds more functionality based on the requirement.|||Now apart from inherited functions, class Novel keeps two additional member functions.|||Function definitions in child classes override definitions with the same name in parent classes. In a child class, we can modify the definition of a function inherited from parent class.|||In the following example getPrice and getTitle functions are overridden to return some values.|||Unless you specify otherwise, properties and methods of a class are public. That is to say, they may be accessed in three possible situations −|||From outside the class in which it is declared|||From within the class in which it is declared|||From within another class that implements the class in which it is declared|||Till now we have seen all members as public members. If you wish to limit the accessibility of the members of a class then you define class members as private or protected.|||By designating a member private, you limit its accessibility to the class in which it is declared. The private member cannot be referred to from classes that inherit the class in which it is declared and cannot be accessed from outside the class.|||A class member can be made private by using private keyword infront of the member.|||When MyClass class is inherited by another class using extends, myPublicFunction() will be visible, as will $driver. The extending class will not have any awareness of or access to myPrivateFunction and $car, because they are declared private.|||A protected property or method is accessible in the class in which it is declared, as well as in classes that extend that class. Protected members are not available outside of those two kinds of classes. A class member can be made protected by using protected keyword in front of the member.|||Here is different version of MyClass −|||Interfaces are defined to provide a common function names to the implementers. Different implementors can implement those interfaces according to their requirements. You can say, interfaces are skeletons which are implemented by developers.|||As of PHP5, it is possible to define an interface, like this −|||Then, if another class implemented that interface, like this −|||A constant is somewhat like a variable, in that it holds a value, but is really more like a function because a constant is immutable. Once you declare a constant, it does not change.|||Declaring one constant is easy, as is done in this version of MyClass −|||In this class, requiredMargin is a constant. It is declared with the keyword const, and under no circumstances can it be changed to anything other than 1.7. Note that the constant's name does not have a leading $, as variable names do.|||An abstract class is one that cannot be instantiated, only inherited. You declare an abstract class with the keyword abstract, like this −|||When inheriting from an abstract class, all methods marked abstract in the parent's class declaration must be defined by the child; additionally, these methods must be defined with the same visibility.|||Note that function definitions inside an abstract class must also be preceded by the keyword abstract. It is not legal to have abstract function definitions inside a non-abstract class.|||Declaring class members or methods as static makes them accessible without needing an instantiation of the class. A member declared as static can not be accessed with an instantiated class object (though a static method can).|||Try out following example −|||PHP 5 introduces the final keyword, which prevents child classes from overriding a method by prefixing the definition with final. If the class itself is being defined final then it cannot be extended.|||Following example results in Fatal error: Cannot override final method BaseClass::moreTesting()|||Instead of writing an entirely new constructor for the subclass, let's write it by calling the parent's constructor explicitly and then doing whatever is necessary in addition for instantiation of the subclass. Here's a simple example −|||In this example, we have a parent class (Name), which has a two-argument constructor, and a subclass (NameSub1), which has a three-argument constructor. The constructor of NameSub1 functions by calling its parent constructor explicitly using the :: syntax (passing two of its arguments along) and then setting an additional field. Similarly, NameSub1 defines its non constructor toString() function in terms of the parent function that it overrides.|||NOTE − A constructor can be defined with the same name as the name of a class. It is defined in above example.","Class − This is a programmer-defined data type, which includes local functions as well as local data.

The language itself is a lot like C, except with untyped variables, a whole lot of Web-specific libraries built in, and everything hooked up directly to your favorite Web server.|||The syntax of statements and function definitions should be familiar, except that variables are always preceded by $, and functions do not require separate prototypes.|||Here we will put some similarities and differences in PHP and C|||Syntax − Broadly speaking, PHP syntax is the same as in C: Code is blank insensitive, statements are terminated with semicolons, function calls have the same structure (my_function(expression1, expression2)), and curly braces ({ and }) make statements into blocks. PHP supports C and C++-style comments (/* */ as well as //), and also Perl and shell-script style (#).|||Operators − The assignment operators (=, +=, *=, and so on), the Boolean operators (&&, ||, !), the comparison operators (<,>, <=, >=, ==, !=), and the basic arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) all behave in PHP as they do in C.|||Control structures − The basic control structures (if, switch, while, for) behave as they do in C, including supporting break and continue. One notable difference is that switch in PHP can accept strings as case identifiers.|||Function names − As you peruse the documentation, you.ll see many function names that seem identical to C functions.|||Dollar signs − All variables are denoted with a leading $. Variables do not need to be declared in advance of assignment, and they have no intrinsic type.|||Types − PHP has only two numerical types: integer (corresponding to a long in C) and double (corresponding to a double in C). Strings are of arbitrary length. There is no separate character type.|||Type conversion − Types are not checked at compile time, and type errors do not typically occur at runtime either. Instead, variables and values are automatically converted across types as needed.|||Arrays − Arrays have a syntax superficially similar to C's array syntax, but they are implemented completely differently. They are actually associative arrays or hashes,  and the index can be either a number or a string. They do not need to be declared or allocated in advance.|||No structure type − There is no structure in PHP, partly because the array and object types together make it unnecessary. The elements of a PHP array need not be of a consistent type.|||No pointers − There are no pointers available in PHP, although the tapeless variables play a similar role. PHP does support variable references. You can also emulate function pointers to some extent, in that function names can be stored in variables and called by using the variable rather than a literal name.|||No prototypes − Functions do not need to be declared before their implementation is defined, as long as the definition can be found somewhere in the current code file or included files.|||Memory management − The PHP engine is effectively a garbage-collected environment (reference-counted), and in small scripts there is no need to do any deallocation. You should freely allocate new structures - such as new strings and object instances. IN PHP5, it is possible to define destructor for objects, but there is no free or delete.  Destructor are called when the last reference to an object goes away, before the memory is reclaimed.|||Compilation and linking − There is no separate compilation step for PHP scripts.|||Permissiveness − As a general matter, PHP is more forgiving than C (especially in its type system) and so will let you get away with new kinds of mistakes.

This will help PERL developers to understand PHP very quickly and avoid common mistakes.|||Compiled scripting languages − Both Perl and PHP are scripting languages.This means that  they are not used to produce native standalone executables in advance of execution.|||Syntax − PHP's basic syntax is very close to Perl's, and both share a lot of syntactic features with C. Code is insensitive to whitespace, statements are terminated by semicolons, and curly braces organize multiple statements into a single block. Function calls start with the name of the function, followed by the actual arguments enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.|||Dollar-sign variables − All variables in PHP look like scalar variables in Perl: a name with a dollar sign ($) in front of it.|||No declaration of variables − As in Perl, you don.t need to declare the type of a PHP variable before using it.|||Loose typing of variables − As in Perl, variables in PHP have no intrinsic type other than the value they currently hold. You can store either number or string in same type of variable.|||Strings and variable interpolation − Both PHP and Perl do more interpretation of double-quoted strings (""string"") than of singlequoted strings ('string').|||PHP is HTML-embedded − Although it is possible to use PHP for arbitrary tasks by running it from the command line, it is more typically connected to a Web server and used for producing Web pages. If you are used to writing CGI scripts in Perl, the main difference in PHP is that you no longer need to explicitly print large blocks of static HTML using print or heredoc statements and instead can simply write the HTML itself outside of the PHP code block.|||No @ or % variables − PHP has one only kind of variable, which starts with a dollar sign ($). Any of the datatypes in the language can be stored in such variables, whether scalar or compound.|||Arrays versus hashes − PHP has a single datatype called an array that plays the role of both hashes and arrays/lists in Perl.|||Specifying arguments to functions − Function calls in PHP look pretty much like subroutine calls in Perl. Function definitions in PHP, on the other hand, typically require some kind of list of formal arguments as in C or Java which is not the csse in PERL.|||Variable scoping in functions − In Perl, the default scope for variables is global. This means that top-level variables are visible inside subroutines. Often, this leads to promiscuous use of globals across functions. In PHP, the scope of variables within function definitions is local by default.|||No module system as such − In PHP there is no real distinction between normal code files and code files used as imported libraries.|||Break and continue rather than next and last − PHP is more like C langauge and uses break and continue instead of next and last statement.|||No elsif − A minor spelling difference: Perl's elsif is PHP's elseif.|||More kinds of comments − In addition to Perl-style (#) single-line comments, PHP offers C-style multiline comments (/* comment */ ) and Java-style single-line comments (// comment).|||Regular expressions − PHP does not have a built-in syntax specific to regular expressions, but has most of the same functionality in its ""Perl-compatible"" regular expression functions.","Compiled scripting languages − Both Perl and PHP are scripting languages.This means that  they are not used to produce native standalone executables in advance of execution.@@@Syntax − PHP's basic syntax is very close to Perl's, and both share a lot of syntactic features with C.
