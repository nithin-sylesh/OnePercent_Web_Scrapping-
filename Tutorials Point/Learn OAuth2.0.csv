Typically, a browser is a user agent.@@@It accesses the data using tokens instead of using their credentials and stores data in online file system of the user such as Google Docs or Dropbox account.|||OAuth 2.0 is a very flexible protocol that relies on SSL (Secure Sockets Layer that ensures data between the web server and browsers remain private) to save user access token.@@@OAuth 2.0 relies on SSL which is used to ensure cryptography industry protocols and are being used to keep the data safe.@@@It allows limited access to the user's data and allows accessing when authorization tokens expire.@@@It has ability to share data for users without having to release personal information.@@@It is easier to implement and provides stronger authentication.|||If you are adding more extension at the ends in the specification, it will produce a wide range of non-interoperable implementations, which means you have to write separate pieces of code for Facebook, Google, etc.@@@If your favorite sites are connected to the central hub and the central account is hacked, then it will lead to serious effects across several sites instead of just one.|||The client requests an access token only with the help of client credentials.@@@The client credentials authorization flow is used to acquire access token to authorize API requests.@@@Using client credentials authorization, access token which is acquired, only grants permission for your client application to search and get catalog documents.|||First, it is necessary to acquire OAuth 2.0 client credentials from API console.@@@Then, the access token is requested from the authorization server by the client.@@@It gets an access token from the response and sends the token to the API that you wish to access.|||client_id − It should be set to the client id of your application.@@@redirect_uri − It should be set to the URL.

In server side applications, you can make sure that the secrets are saved safely.|||Bearer Token − The access token can only be placed in POST request body or GET URL parameter as a fallback option in the authorization HTTP header.|||MAC − A cryptographic Message Authentication Code (MAC) is computed using the elements of the request and is sent to the authorization header.

OAuth provides some additional terms to understand the concepts of authorization.
|||2@@@Web Server
Web server delivers the web pages and uses HTTP to serve the files that forms the web pages to the users.
|||3@@@User-Agent
The user agent application is used by client applications in the user's device, which acts as the scripting language instance.
|||4@@@Native Application
Native application can be used as an instance of desktop or mobile phone application, which uses the resource owner password credentials.
&&&Sr.No.@@@Concept & Description|||1@@@Obtaining End-User Authorization
The authorization end point is typically URI on the authorization server in which the resource owner logs in and permits to access the data to the client application.
|||2@@@Authorization Response
The authorization response can be used to get the access token for accessing the owner resources in the system using the authorization code.
|||3@@@Error Response and Codes
The authorization server responds with a HTTP 400 or 401 (bad request) status codes, if an error occurs during authorization.
&&&Sr.No.@@@Concept & Description|||1@@@Authorization Code
The authorization code allows accessing the authorization request and grants access to the client application to fetch the owner resources.
|||2@@@Resource Owner Password Credentials
The resource owner password credentials include only one request and one response, and is useful where the resource owner has a good relationship with the client.
|||3@@@Assertion
Assertion is a package of information that makes the sharing of identity and security information across various security domains possible.
|||4@@@Refresh Token
The refresh tokens are used to acquire a new access tokens, which carries the information necessary to get a new access token.
|||5@@@Access Token Response
Access token is a type of token that is assigned by the authorization server.
|||6@@@Access Token Error Response Codes
If the token access request, which is issued by the authorization server is invalid or unauthorized, then the authorization server returns an error response.
&&&Sr.No.@@@Concept & Description|||1@@@Authenticated Requests
It is used to get the authorization code token for accessing the owner resources in the system.
|||2@@@The WWW-Authenticate Response Header Field
The resource server includes the ""WWW-Authenticate"" response header field, if the protected resource request contains an invalid access token.
