Learn Unix Sockets,What is a Socket?,"What is a Socket?|||Where is Socket Used?@@@Socket Types@@@What is Next?@@@Useful Video Courses|||Fundamentals of Unix and Linux System Administration@@@Essentials of Unix Operating System@@@Unix Command Course for Beginners@@@Linux/Unix For DevOps and Developers@@@Linux, Unix OS Command Line and Shell Scripting Introduction@@@Unix and Linux Training","Sockets allow communication between two different processes on the same or different machines. To be more precise, it's a way to talk to other computers using standard Unix file descriptors. In Unix, every I/O action is done by writing or reading a file descriptor. A file descriptor is just an integer associated with an open file and it can be a network connection, a text file, a terminal, or something else.|||To a programmer, a socket looks and behaves much like a low-level file descriptor. This is because commands such as read() and write() work with sockets in the same way they do with files and pipes.|||Sockets were first introduced in 2.1BSD and subsequently refined into their current form with 4.2BSD. The sockets feature is now available with most current UNIX system releases.|||A Unix Socket is used in a client-server application framework. A server is a process that performs some functions on request from a client. Most of the application-level protocols like FTP, SMTP, and POP3 make use of sockets to establish connection between client and server and then for exchanging data.|||There are four types of sockets available to the users. The first two are most commonly used and the last two are rarely used.|||Processes are presumed to communicate only between sockets of the same type but there is no restriction that prevents communication between sockets of different types.|||Stream Sockets − Delivery in a networked environment is guaranteed. If you send through the stream socket three items ""A, B, C"", they will arrive in the same order − ""A, B, C"". These sockets use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for data transmission. If delivery is impossible, the sender receives an error indicator. Data records do not have any boundaries.|||Datagram Sockets − Delivery in a networked environment is not guaranteed. They're connectionless because you don't need to have an open connection as in Stream Sockets − you build a packet with the destination information and send it out. They use UDP (User Datagram Protocol).|||Raw Sockets − These provide users access to the underlying communication protocols, which support socket abstractions. These sockets are normally datagram oriented, though their exact characteristics are dependent on the interface provided by the protocol. Raw sockets are not intended for the general user; they have been provided mainly for those interested in developing new communication protocols, or for gaining access to some of the more cryptic facilities of an existing protocol.|||Sequenced Packet Sockets − They are similar to a stream socket, with the exception that record boundaries are preserved. This interface is provided only as a part of the Network Systems (NS) socket abstraction, and is very important in most serious NS applications. Sequenced-packet sockets allow the user to manipulate the Sequence Packet Protocol (SPP) or Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP) headers on a packet or a group of packets, either by writing a prototype header along with whatever data is to be sent, or by specifying a default header to be used with all outgoing data, and allows the user to receive the headers on incoming packets.|||The next few chapters are meant to strengthen your basics and prepare a foundation before you can write Server and Client programs using socket. If you directly want to jump to see how to write a client and server program, then you can do so but it is not recommended. It is strongly recommended that you go step by step and complete these initial few chapters to make your base before moving on to do programming.","Stream Sockets − Delivery in a networked environment is guaranteed.

IP stands for Internet Protocol and refers to the Internet Layer of the overall network architecture of the Internet.|||An IP address is a 32-bit quantity interpreted as four 8-bit numbers or octets. Each IP address uniquely identifies the participating user network, the host on the network, and the class of the user network.|||An IP address is usually written in a dotted-decimal notation of the form N1.N2.N3.N4, where each Ni is a decimal number between 0 and 255 decimal (00 through FF hexadecimal).|||IP addresses are managed and created by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). There are five different address classes. You can determine which class an IP address is in by examining the first four bits of the IP address.|||Class A addresses begin with 0xxx, or 1 to 126 decimal.|||Class B addresses begin with 10xx, or 128 to 191 decimal.|||Class C addresses begin with 110x, or 192 to 223 decimal.|||Class D addresses begin with 1110, or 224 to 239 decimal.|||Class E addresses begin with 1111, or 240 to 254 decimal.|||Addresses beginning with 01111111, or 127 decimal, are reserved for loopback and for internal testing on a local machine [You can test this: you should always be able to ping 127.0.0.1, which points to yourself]; Class D addresses are reserved for multicasting; Class E addresses are reserved for future use. They should not be used for host addresses.|||Subnetting or subnetworking basically means to branch off a network. It can be done for a variety of reasons like network in an organization, use of different physical media (such as Ethernet, FDDI, WAN, etc.), preservation of address space, and security. The most common reason is to control network traffic.|||The basic idea in subnetting is to partition the host identifier portion of the IP address into two parts −|||For example, a common Class B address format is N1.N2.S.H, where N1.N2 identifies the Class B network, the 8-bit S field identifies the subnet, and the 8-bit H field identifies the host on the subnet.","Class A addresses begin with 0xxx, or 1 to 126 decimal.@@@Class B addresses begin with 10xx, or 128 to 191 decimal.@@@Class C addresses begin with 110x, or 192 to 223 decimal.@@@Class D addresses begin with 1110, or 224 to 239 decimal.@@@Class E addresses begin with 1111, or 240 to 254 decimal.|||A subnet address within the network address itself; and@@@A host address on the subnet.",,Class@@@Leftmost bits@@@Start address@@@Finish address|||A@@@0xxx@@@0.0.0.0@@@127.255.255.255|||B@@@10xx@@@128.0.0.0@@@191.255.255.255|||C@@@110x@@@192.0.0.0@@@223.255.255.255|||D@@@1110@@@224.0.0.0 @@@239.255.255.255|||E@@@1111@@@240.0.0.0 @@@255.255.255.255,

One of the two processes acts as a client process, and another process acts as a server.|||This is the process, which typically makes a request for information. After getting the response, this process may terminate or may do some other processing.|||Example, Internet Browser works as a client application, which sends a request to the Web Server to get one HTML webpage.|||This is the process which takes a request from the clients. After getting a request from the client, this process will perform the required processing, gather the requested information, and send it to the requestor client. Once done, it becomes ready to serve another client. Server processes are always alert and ready to serve incoming requests.|||Example − Web Server keeps waiting for requests from Internet Browsers and as soon as it gets any request from a browser, it picks up a requested HTML page and sends it back to that Browser.|||Note that the client needs to know the address of the server, but the server does not need to know the address or even the existence of the client prior to the connection being established. Once a connection is established, both sides can send and receive information.|||There are two types of client-server architectures −|||2-tier architecture − In this architecture, the client directly interacts with the server. This type of architecture may have some security holes and performance problems. Internet Explorer and Web Server work on two-tier architecture. Here security problems are resolved using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).|||3-tier architectures − In this architecture, one more software sits in between the client and the server. This middle software is called ‘middleware’. Middleware are used to perform all the security checks and load balancing in case of heavy load. A middleware takes all requests from the client and after performing the required authentication, it passes that request to the server. Then the server does the required processing and sends the response back to the middleware and finally the middleware passes this response back to the client. If you want to implement a 3-tier architecture, then you can keep any middleware like Web Logic or WebSphere software in between your Web Server and Web Browser.|||There are two types of servers you can have −|||Iterative Server − This is the simplest form of server where a server process serves one client and after completing the first request, it takes request from another client. Meanwhile, another client keeps waiting.|||Concurrent Servers − This type of server runs multiple concurrent processes to serve many requests at a time because one process may take longer and another client cannot wait for so long. The simplest way to write a concurrent server under Unix is to fork a child process to handle each client separately.|||The system calls for establishing a connection are somewhat different for the client and the server, but both involve the basic construct of a socket. Both the processes establish their own sockets.|||The steps involved in establishing a socket on the client side are as follows −|||Create a socket with the socket() system call.|||Connect the socket to the address of the server using the connect() system call.|||Send and receive data. There are a number of ways to do this, but the simplest  way is to use the read() and write() system calls.|||The steps involved in establishing a socket on the server side are as follows −|||Create a socket with the socket() system call.|||Bind the socket to an address using the bind() system call.

You can set a port above 1024 and below 65535 unless they are the ones being used by other programs.|||The listen function is called only by a TCP server and it performs two actions −|||The listen function converts an unconnected socket into a passive socket, indicating that the kernel should accept incoming connection requests directed to this socket.|||The second argument to this function specifies the maximum number of connections the kernel should queue for this socket.|||This call returns 0 on success, otherwise it returns -1 on error.|||sockfd − It is a socket descriptor returned by the socket function.|||backlog − It is the number of allowed connections.|||The accept function is called by a TCP server to return the next completed connection from the front of the completed connection queue. The signature of the call is as follows −|||This call returns a non-negative descriptor on success, otherwise it returns -1 on error. The returned descriptor is assumed to be a client socket descriptor and all read-write operations will be done on this descriptor to communicate with the client.|||sockfd − It is a socket descriptor returned by the socket function.|||cliaddr − It is a pointer to struct sockaddr that contains client IP address and port.|||addrlen − Set it to sizeof(struct sockaddr).|||The send function is used to send data over stream sockets or CONNECTED datagram sockets.

An application could be doing other useful processing while the incoming data stream is empty. Another situation is when an application receives data from multiple sockets.|||Calling recv or recvfrom on a socket that has no data in its input queue prevents immediate reception of data from other sockets.

It can be NULL to indicate an empty set.|||exceptfds − It points to an object of type fd_set that on input, specifies the file descriptors to be checked for error conditions pending, and  on output indicates, which file descriptors have error conditions pending. It can be NULL to indicate an empty set.|||timeout − It points to a timeval struct that specifies how long the select call should poll the descriptors for an available I/O operation. If the timeout value is 0, then select will return immediately. If the timeout argument is NULL, then select will block until at least one file/socket handle is ready for an available I/O operation. Otherwise select will return after the amount of time in the timeout has elapsed OR when at least one file/socket descriptor is ready for an I/O operation.|||The return value from select is the number of handles specified in the file descriptor sets that are ready for I/O. If the time limit specified by the timeout field is reached, select return 0.

To be more precise, it's a way to talk to other computers using standard Unix file descriptors. In Unix, every I/O action is done by writing or reading a file descriptor. A file descriptor is just an integer associated with an open file and it can be a network connection, a text file, a terminal, or something else.|||To a programmer, a socket looks and behaves much like a low-level file descriptor. This is because commands such as read() and write() work with sockets in the same way they do with files and pipes.|||Sockets were first introduced in 2.1BSD and subsequently refined into their current form with 4.2BSD. The sockets feature is now available with most current UNIX system releases.|||A Unix Socket is used in a client-server application framework. A server is a process that performs some functions on request from a client. Most of the application-level protocols like FTP, SMTP, and POP3 make use of sockets to establish connection between client and server and then for exchanging data.|||There are four types of sockets available to the users. The first two are most commonly used and the last two are rarely used.|||Processes are presumed to communicate only between sockets of the same type but there is no restriction that prevents communication between sockets of different types.|||Stream Sockets − Delivery in a networked environment is guaranteed. If you send through the stream socket three items ""A, B, C"", they will arrive in the same order − ""A, B, C"". These sockets use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for data transmission. If delivery is impossible, the sender receives an error indicator. Data records do not have any boundaries.|||Datagram Sockets − Delivery in a networked environment is not guaranteed. They're connectionless because you don't need to have an open connection as in Stream Sockets − you build a packet with the destination information and send it out. They use UDP (User Datagram Protocol).|||Raw Sockets − These provide users access to the underlying communication protocols, which support socket abstractions. These sockets are normally datagram oriented, though their exact characteristics are dependent on the interface provided by the protocol. Raw sockets are not intended for the general user; they have been provided mainly for those interested in developing new communication protocols, or for gaining access to some of the more cryptic facilities of an existing protocol.|||Sequenced Packet Sockets − They are similar to a stream socket, with the exception that record boundaries are preserved. This interface is provided only as a part of the Network Systems (NS) socket abstraction, and is very important in most serious NS applications. Sequenced-packet sockets allow the user to manipulate the Sequence Packet Protocol (SPP) or Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP) headers on a packet or a group of packets, either by writing a prototype header along with whatever data is to be sent, or by specifying a default header to be used with all outgoing data, and allows the user to receive the headers on incoming packets.|||The next few chapters are meant to strengthen your basics and prepare a foundation before you can write Server and Client programs using socket. If you directly want to jump to see how to write a client and server program, then you can do so but it is not recommended. It is strongly recommended that you go step by step and complete these initial few chapters to make your base before moving on to do programming.|||Before we proceed with the actual stuff, let us discuss a bit about the Network Addresses − the IP Address.|||The IP host address, or more commonly just IP address, is used to identify hosts connected to the Internet. IP stands for Internet Protocol and refers to the Internet Layer of the overall network architecture of the Internet.|||An IP address is a 32-bit quantity interpreted as four 8-bit numbers or octets. Each IP address uniquely identifies the participating user network, the host on the network, and the class of the user network.|||An IP address is usually written in a dotted-decimal notation of the form N1.N2.N3.N4, where each Ni is a decimal number between 0 and 255 decimal (00 through FF hexadecimal).|||IP addresses are managed and created by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). There are five different address classes. You can determine which class an IP address is in by examining the first four bits of the IP address.|||Class A addresses begin with 0xxx, or 1 to 126 decimal.|||Class B addresses begin with 10xx, or 128 to 191 decimal.|||Class C addresses begin with 110x, or 192 to 223 decimal.|||Class D addresses begin with 1110, or 224 to 239 decimal.|||Class E addresses begin with 1111, or 240 to 254 decimal.|||Addresses beginning with 01111111, or 127 decimal, are reserved for loopback and for internal testing on a local machine [You can test this: you should always be able to ping 127.0.0.1, which points to yourself]; Class D addresses are reserved for multicasting; Class E addresses are reserved for future use. They should not be used for host addresses.|||Subnetting or subnetworking basically means to branch off a network. It can be done for a variety of reasons like network in an organization, use of different physical media (such as Ethernet, FDDI, WAN, etc.), preservation of address space, and security. The most common reason is to control network traffic.|||The basic idea in subnetting is to partition the host identifier portion of the IP address into two parts −|||For example, a common Class B address format is N1.N2.S.H, where N1.N2 identifies the Class B network, the 8-bit S field identifies the subnet, and the 8-bit H field identifies the host on the subnet.|||Host names in terms of numbers are difficult to remember and hence they are termed by ordinary names such as Takshila or Nalanda. We write software applications to find out the dotted IP address corresponding to a given name.|||The process of finding out dotted IP address based on the given alphanumeric host name is known as hostname resolution.|||A hostname resolution is done by special software residing on high-capacity systems. These systems are called Domain Name Systems (DNS), which keep the mapping of IP addresses and the corresponding ordinary names.|||The correspondence between host names and IP addresses is maintained in a file called hosts. On most of the systems, this file is found in /etc directory.|||Entries in this file look like the following −|||Note that more than one name may be associated with a given IP address. This file is used while converting from IP address to host name and vice versa.|||You would not have access to edit this file, so if you want to put any host name along with IP address, then you would need to have root permission.|||Most of the Net Applications use the Client-Server architecture, which refers to two processes or two applications that communicate with each other to exchange some information. One of the two processes acts as a client process, and another process acts as a server.|||This is the process, which typically makes a request for information. After getting the response, this process may terminate or may do some other processing.|||Example, Internet Browser works as a client application, which sends a request to the Web Server to get one HTML webpage.|||This is the process which takes a request from the clients. After getting a request from the client, this process will perform the required processing, gather the requested information, and send it to the requestor client. Once done, it becomes ready to serve another client. Server processes are always alert and ready to serve incoming requests.|||Example − Web Server keeps waiting for requests from Internet Browsers and as soon as it gets any request from a browser, it picks up a requested HTML page and sends it back to that Browser.|||Note that the client needs to know the address of the server, but the server does not need to know the address or even the existence of the client prior to the connection being established. Once a connection is established, both sides can send and receive information.|||There are two types of client-server architectures −|||2-tier architecture − In this architecture, the client directly interacts with the server. This type of architecture may have some security holes and performance problems. Internet Explorer and Web Server work on two-tier architecture. Here security problems are resolved using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).|||3-tier architectures − In this architecture, one more software sits in between the client and the server. This middle software is called ‘middleware’. Middleware are used to perform all the security checks and load balancing in case of heavy load. A middleware takes all requests from the client and after performing the required authentication, it passes that request to the server. Then the server does the required processing and sends the response back to the middleware and finally the middleware passes this response back to the client. If you want to implement a 3-tier architecture, then you can keep any middleware like Web Logic or WebSphere software in between your Web Server and Web Browser.|||There are two types of servers you can have −|||Iterative Server − This is the simplest form of server where a server process serves one client and after completing the first request, it takes request from another client. Meanwhile, another client keeps waiting.|||Concurrent Servers − This type of server runs multiple concurrent processes to serve many requests at a time because one process may take longer and another client cannot wait for so long. The simplest way to write a concurrent server under Unix is to fork a child process to handle each client separately.|||The system calls for establishing a connection are somewhat different for the client and the server, but both involve the basic construct of a socket. Both the processes establish their own sockets.|||The steps involved in establishing a socket on the client side are as follows −|||Create a socket with the socket() system call.|||Connect the socket to the address of the server using the connect() system call.|||Send and receive data. There are a number of ways to do this, but the simplest  way is to use the read() and write() system calls.|||The steps involved in establishing a socket on the server side are as follows −|||Create a socket with the socket() system call.|||Bind the socket to an address using the bind() system call. For a server socket on the Internet, an address consists of a port number on the host machine.|||Listen for connections with the listen() system call.|||Accept a connection with the accept() system call. This call typically blocks the connection until a client connects with the server.|||Send and receive data using the read() and write() system calls.|||Following is the diagram showing the complete Client and Server interaction −|||Various structures are used in Unix Socket Programming to hold information about the address and port, and other information. Most socket functions require a pointer to a socket address structure as an argument. Structures defined in this chapter are related to Internet Protocol Family.|||The first structure is sockaddr that holds the socket information −|||This is a generic socket address structure, which will be passed in most of the socket function calls. The following table provides a description of the member fields −|||AF_INET|||AF_UNIX|||AF_NS|||AF_IMPLINK|||The second structure that helps you to reference to the socket's elements is as follows −|||Here is the description of the member fields −|||AF_INET|||AF_UNIX|||AF_NS|||AF_IMPLINK|||This structure is used only in the above structure as a structure field and holds 32 bit netid/hostid.|||Here is the description of the member fields −|||This structure is used to keep information related to host.|||Here is the description of the member fields −|||NOTE − h_addr is defined as h_addr_list[0] to keep backward compatibility.|||This particular structure is used to keep information related to service and associated ports.|||Here is the description of the member fields −|||TCP|||UDP|||Socket address structures are an integral part of every network program. We allocate them, fill them in, and pass pointers to them to various socket functions. Sometimes we pass a pointer to one of these structures to a socket function and it fills in the contents.|||We always pass these structures by reference (i.e., we pass a pointer to the structure, not the structure itself), and we always pass the size of the structure as another argument.|||When a socket function fills in a structure, the length is also passed by reference, so that its value can be updated by the function. We call these value-result arguments.|||Always, set the structure variables to NULL (i.e., '\0') by using memset() for bzero() functions, otherwise it may get unexpected junk values in your structure.|||When a client process wants to a connect a server, the client must have a way of identifying the server that it wants to connect. If the client knows the 32-bit Internet address of the host on which the server resides, it can contact that host. But how does the client identify the particular server process running on that host?|||To resolve the problem of identifying a particular server process running on a host, both TCP and UDP have defined a group of well-known ports.|||For our purpose, a port will be defined as an integer number between 1024 and 65535. This is because all port numbers smaller than 1024 are considered well-known -- for example, telnet uses port 23, http uses 80, ftp uses 21, and so on.|||The port assignments to network services can be found in the file /etc/services. If you are writing your own server then care must be taken to assign a port to your server. You should make sure that this port should not be assigned to any other server.|||Normally it is a practice to assign any port number more than 5000. But there are many organizations who have written servers having port numbers more than 5000. For example, Yahoo Messenger runs on 5050, SIP Server runs on 5060, etc.|||Here is a small list of services and associated ports. You can find the most updated list of internet ports and associated service at IANA - TCP/IP Port Assignments.|||Unix provides the following functions to fetch service name from the /etc/services file.|||struct servent *getservbyname(char *name, char *proto) − This call takes service name and protocol name, and returns the corresponding port number for that service.|||struct servent *getservbyport(int port, char *proto) − This call takes port number and protocol name, and returns the corresponding service name.|||The return value for each function is a pointer to a structure with the following form −|||Here is the description of the member fields −|||TCP|||UDP|||Unfortunately, not all computers store the bytes that comprise a multibyte value in the same order. Consider a 16-bit internet that is made up of 2 bytes. There are two ways to store this value.|||Little Endian − In this scheme, low-order byte is stored on the starting address (A) and high-order byte is stored on the next address (A + 1).|||Big Endian − In this scheme, high-order byte is stored on the starting address (A) and low-order byte is stored on the next address (A + 1).|||To allow machines with different byte order conventions communicate with each other, the Internet protocols specify a canonical byte order convention for data transmitted over the network. This is known as Network Byte Order.|||While establishing an Internet socket connection, you must make sure that the data in the sin_port and sin_addr members of the sockaddr_in structure are represented in Network Byte Order.|||Routines for converting data between a host's internal representation and Network Byte Order are as follows −|||Listed below are some more detail about these functions −|||unsigned short htons(unsigned short hostshort) − This function converts 16-bit (2-byte) quantities from host byte order to network byte order.|||unsigned long htonl(unsigned long hostlong) − This function converts 32-bit (4-byte) quantities from host byte order to network byte order.|||unsigned short ntohs(unsigned short netshort) − This function converts 16-bit (2-byte) quantities from network byte order to host byte order.|||unsigned long ntohl(unsigned long netlong) − This function converts 32-bit quantities from network byte order to host byte order.|||These functions are macros and result in the insertion of conversion source code into the calling program.

If you send through the stream socket three items ""A, B, C"", they will arrive in the same order − ""A, B, C"". These sockets use TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) for data transmission. If delivery is impossible, the sender receives an error indicator. Data records do not have any boundaries.@@@Datagram Sockets − Delivery in a networked environment is not guaranteed. They're connectionless because you don't need to have an open connection as in Stream Sockets − you build a packet with the destination information and send it out. They use UDP (User Datagram Protocol).@@@Raw Sockets − These provide users access to the underlying communication protocols, which support socket abstractions. These sockets are normally datagram oriented, though their exact characteristics are dependent on the interface provided by the protocol. Raw sockets are not intended for the general user; they have been provided mainly for those interested in developing new communication protocols, or for gaining access to some of the more cryptic facilities of an existing protocol.@@@Sequenced Packet Sockets − They are similar to a stream socket, with the exception that record boundaries are preserved. This interface is provided only as a part of the Network Systems (NS) socket abstraction, and is very important in most serious NS applications. Sequenced-packet sockets allow the user to manipulate the Sequence Packet Protocol (SPP) or Internet Datagram Protocol (IDP) headers on a packet or a group of packets, either by writing a prototype header along with whatever data is to be sent, or by specifying a default header to be used with all outgoing data, and allows the user to receive the headers on incoming packets.|||Class A addresses begin with 0xxx, or 1 to 126 decimal.@@@Class B addresses begin with 10xx, or 128 to 191 decimal.@@@Class C addresses begin with 110x, or 192 to 223 decimal.@@@Class D addresses begin with 1110, or 224 to 239 decimal.@@@Class E addresses begin with 1111, or 240 to 254 decimal.|||A subnet address within the network address itself; and@@@A host address on the subnet.|||2-tier architecture − In this architecture, the client directly interacts with the server. This type of architecture may have some security holes and performance problems. Internet Explorer and Web Server work on two-tier architecture. Here security problems are resolved using Secure Socket Layer (SSL).@@@3-tier architectures − In this architecture, one more software sits in between the client and the server. This middle software is called ‘middleware’. Middleware are used to perform all the security checks and load balancing in case of heavy load. A middleware takes all requests from the client and after performing the required authentication, it passes that request to the server. Then the server does the required processing and sends the response back to the middleware and finally the middleware passes this response back to the client. If you want to implement a 3-tier architecture, then you can keep any middleware like Web Logic or WebSphere software in between your Web Server and Web Browser.|||Iterative Server − This is the simplest form of server where a server process serves one client and after completing the first request, it takes request from another client. Meanwhile, another client keeps waiting.@@@Concurrent Servers − This type of server runs multiple concurrent processes to serve many requests at a time because one process may take longer and another client cannot wait for so long. The simplest way to write a concurrent server under Unix is to fork a child process to handle each client separately.|||Create a socket with the socket() system call.@@@Connect the socket to the address of the server using the connect() system call.@@@Send and receive data.

As all of this code is in an infinite loop, it will return to the accept statement to wait for the next connection.|||Create a socket with the socket() system call.@@@Connect the socket to the address of the server using the connect() system call.@@@Send and receive data. There are a number of ways to do this, but the simplest way is to use the read() and write() system calls.|||struct servent *getservbyname(char *name, char *proto) − This call takes a service name and a protocol name and returns the corresponding port number for that service.@@@struct servent *getservbyport(int port, char *proto) − This call takes a port number and a protocol name and returns the corresponding service name.|||unsigned short htons (unsigned short hostshort) − This function converts 16-bit (2-byte) quantities from host byte order to network byte order.@@@unsigned long htonl (unsigned long hostlong) − This function converts 32-bit (4-byte) quantities from host byte order to network byte order.@@@unsigned short ntohs (unsigned short netshort) − This function converts 16-bit (2-byte) quantities from network byte order to host byte order.@@@unsigned long ntohl (unsigned long netlong) − This function converts 32-bit quantities from network byte order to host byte order.|||int inet_aton (const char *strptr, struct in_addr *addrptr) − This function call converts the specified string, in the Internet standard dot notation, to a network address, and stores the address in the structure provided. The converted address will be in Network Byte Order (bytes ordered from left to right). It returns 1 if the string is valid and 0 on error.@@@in_addr_t inet_addr (const char *strptr) − This function call converts the specified string, in the Internet standard dot notation, to an integer value suitable for use as an Internet address. The converted address will be in Network Byte Order (bytes ordered from left to right). It returns a 32-bit binary network byte ordered IPv4 address and INADDR_NONE on error.@@@char *inet_ntoa (struct in_addr inaddr) − This function call converts the specified Internet host address to a string in the Internet standard dot notation.|||int socket (int family, int type, int protocol) − This call returns a socket descriptor that you can use in later system calls or it gives you -1 on error.@@@int connect (int sockfd, struct sockaddr *serv_addr, int addrlen) − The connect function is used by a TCP client to establish a connection with a TCP server. This call returns 0 if it successfully connects to the server, otherwise it returns -1.@@@int bind(int sockfd, struct sockaddr *my_addr,int addrlen) − The bind function assigns a local protocol address to a socket. This call returns 0 if it successfully binds to the address, otherwise it returns -1.@@@int listen(int sockfd, int backlog) − The listen function is called only by a TCP server to listen for the client request. This call returns 0 on success, otherwise it returns -1.@@@int accept (int sockfd, struct sockaddr *cliaddr, socklen_t *addrlen) − The accept function is called by a TCP server to accept client requests and to establish actual connection. This call returns a non-negative descriptor on success, otherwise it returns -1.@@@int send(int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, int flags) − The send function is used to send data over stream sockets or CONNECTED datagram sockets. This call returns the number of bytes sent out, otherwise it returns -1.@@@int recv (int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags) − The recv function is used to receive data over stream sockets or CONNECTED datagram sockets. This call returns the number of bytes read into the buffer, otherwise it returns -1 on error.@@@int sendto (int sockfd, const void *msg, int len, unsigned int flags, const struct sockaddr *to, int tolen) − The sendto function is used to send data over UNCONNECTED datagram sockets. This call returns the number of bytes sent, otherwise it returns -1 on error.@@@int recvfrom (int sockfd, void *buf, int len, unsigned int flags struct sockaddr *from, int *fromlen) − The recvfrom function is used to receive data from UNCONNECTED datagram sockets. This call returns the number of bytes read into the buffer, otherwise it returns -1 on error.@@@int close (int sockfd) − The close function is used to close a communication between the client and the server. This call returns 0 on success, otherwise it returns -1.@@@int shutdown (int sockfd, int how) − The shutdown function is used to gracefully close a communication between the client and the server. This function gives more control in comparison to close function. It returns 0 on success, -1 otherwise.@@@int select (int nfds, fd_set *readfds, fd_set *writefds, fd_set *errorfds, struct timeval *timeout) − This function is used to read or write multiple sockets.|||int write (int fildes, const void *buf, int nbyte) − The write function attempts to write nbyte bytes from the buffer pointed to by buf to the file associated with the open file descriptor, fildes. Upon successful completion, write() returns the number of bytes actually written to the file associated with fildes. This number is never greater than nbyte. Otherwise, -1 is returned.@@@int read (int fildes, const void *buf, int nbyte) − The read function attempts to read nbyte bytes from the file associated with the open file descriptor, fildes, into the buffer pointed to by buf. Upon successful completion, write() returns the number of bytes actually written to the file associated with fildes. This number is never greater than nbyte. Otherwise, -1 is returned.@@@int fork (void) − The fork function creates a new process. The new process, called the child process, will be an exact copy of the calling process (parent process).@@@void bzero (void *s, int nbyte) − The bzero function places nbyte null bytes in the string s. This function will be used to set all the socket structures with null values.@@@int bcmp (const void *s1, const void *s2, int nbyte) − The bcmp function compares the byte string s1 against the byte string s2. Both the strings are assumed to be nbyte bytes long.@@@void bcopy (const void *s1, void *s2, int nbyte) − The bcopy function copies nbyte bytes from the string s1 to the string s2. Overlapping strings are handled correctly.@@@void *memset(void *s, int c, int nbyte) − The memset function is also used to set structure variables in the same way as bzero.",,"Class@@@Leftmost bits@@@Start address@@@Finish address|||A@@@0xxx@@@0.0.0.0@@@127.255.255.255|||B@@@10xx@@@128.0.0.0@@@191.255.255.255|||C@@@110x@@@192.0.0.0@@@223.255.255.255|||D@@@1110@@@224.0.0.0 @@@239.255.255.255|||E@@@1111@@@240.0.0.0 @@@255.255.255.255&&&Attribute@@@Values@@@Description|||sa_family@@@
