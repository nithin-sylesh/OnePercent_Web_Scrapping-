The println() function is used to output/print text, and in our example it will output ""Hello World"".|||Good To Know: In Kotlin, code statements do not have to end with a semicolon (;) (which is often required for other programming languages, such as Java, C++, C#, etc.).|||Before Kotlin version 1.3, it was required to use the main() function with parameters, like: fun main(args : Array<String>).
