For example,|||Here, age is a variable of the int data type, and we have assigned an integer value 14 to it.|||Note: The int data type suggests that the variable can only hold integers. Similarly, we can use the double data type if we have to store decimals and exponentials.|||We will learn about all the data types in detail in the next tutorial.|||The value of a variable can be changed, hence the name variable.|||Note: We should try to give meaningful names to variables. For example, first_name is a better variable name than fn.|||Literals are data used for representing fixed values. They can be used directly in the code. For example: 1, 2.5, 'c' etc.|||Here, 1, 2.5 and 'c' are literals. Why? You cannot assign different values to these terms.|||Here's a list of different literals in C++ programming.|||An integer is a numeric literal(associated with numbers) without any fractional or exponential part. There are three types of integer literals in C programming:|||For example:|||In C++ programming, octal starts with a 0, and hexadecimal starts with a 0x.|||A floating-point literal is a numeric literal that has either a fractional form or an exponent form. For example:||||||-2.0|||0.0000234|||-0.22E-5|||Note: E-5 = 10-5|||A character literal is created by enclosing a single character inside single quotation marks. For example: 'a', 'm', 'F', '2', '}' etc.|||Sometimes, it is necessary to use characters that cannot be typed or has special meaning in C++ programming. For example, newline (enter), tab, question mark, etc.|||In order to use these characters, escape sequences are used.|||A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double-quote marks. For example:|||We will learn about strings in detail in the C++ string tutorial.|||In C++, we can create variables whose value cannot be changed. For that, we use the const keyword. Here's an example:|||Here, we have used the keyword const to declare a constant named LIGHT_SPEED. If we try to change the value of LIGHT_SPEED, we will get an error.|||A constant can also be created using the #define preprocessor directive.

It was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1979.|||Many of today’s operating systems, system drivers, browsers and games use C++ as their core language, making it one of the most popular languages used.|||This is a comprehensive guide that explores the reasons you should consider learning C++ and the ways you can get started with C++.|||If you directly want to get started with learning C++, visit our C++ Tutorial page.|||Since, C++ is an extended version of C, the C part of it is very low level.|||This offers a huge boost in speed that high-level languages like Python and Java cannot provide.|||Since C++ is a statically typed programming language, it does not allow the compiler to make assumptions about the type of data. For example, 10 is different from ""10"" and it must be declared explicitly.|||Since these are determined at compile-time, it helps the compiler catch errors and bugs before the execution of the program.|||C++ supports at least 7 different styles of programming and gives developers the freedom to choose one at their will.|||Unlike Java, you don’t need to use objects to solve every task unless necessary.|||C++ supports Object-Oriented programming, which provides a clear modular structure for programs.|||With its use in C++, you are able to divide these complex problems into smaller sets by creating objects.|||The use of C++ can be further extended using the standard library it contains.|||These libraries contain efficient algorithms that you can use extensively while coding your own projects.|||This saves an ample amount of programming effort, which otherwise would have been wasted reinventing the wheel.|||With the use of C++ in the development of modern games, operating systems, browsers, and much more, it is safe to say that C++ is irreplaceable. Many major companies like Adobe, Amazon, Facebook, and Autodesk use C++ in their products.|||Since C++ is a middle-level language, you will write code that interacts directly with the internal hardware of the computer. Due to this, you will understand how computer memory works and how information can be stored and retrieved.|||It is sure to expand your knowledge of the architecture of the computer.||||||C++ has a large supporting community. There are numerous active online forums that can come in handy if you are stuck anywhere in the learning process.|||If you know C++, you can contribute to large open-source projects that impact hundreds of millions of people. Some of the larger open source projects where C++ programming is used are TensorFlow, Electron, OpenCV, etc.|||A lot of popular programming languages are based on C (and C++, considered superset of C programming with OOP features). Hence, if you know C and C++, you will not have any problem switching to another language.|||C++ developers can expect an average of $100,000 salary with surplus job opportunities.|||The requirement of jobs comes mostly for game development, rendering engines, and creating Windows applications.|||Whatever medium you use to learn C++, it all comes down to practicing what you have done by writing programs. Only practice will make you a better programmer.|||Don’t just copy others' code and run it. Take some time to think about what the code actually does. Replicate it on your system and see what errors occur and most importantly, learn from them.|||It is really important to follow a good C++ standard when you start programming. Even though they give you less freedom when you start out, they are helpful while are scaling your program and advancing in C++.|||Take a look at IsoCPP’s coding standard FAQ and also follow the C++ Core Guidelines.|||Join Github’s open-source projects and read others' code. This can be overwhelming at first when you see all the code in the project. You can use Code Whittling to start small and only focus on one thing at a moment.|||You’ll not only learn others' styles of coding but you’ll also understand how they think.|||Get help from others. There are tons of great C++ communities that will help you solve real-life problems and most importantly, become a better developer.|||Some of them are:|||We at Programiz think C++ is a terrific language to learn. Even for beginners, it helps to understand the working of programs and computers in general.|||Learning any language takes time and that holds even more true for C++. Since it is not a high-level language, learning C++ can get overwhelming when you start and you will need to be prepared to put in thoughtful hours to learn the basics.|||This experience will, however, take you a long way to become a great developer.",What is C++ programming?$$$Features of C++$$$Why learn C++?$$$How to learn C++?$$$How to get better at C++?$$$Final Words,"StackOverflow - Most Popular programming Q&A site on the web$$$Codechef - Practice questions, challenges and a large community of programmers$$$CodeProject - For those who code, with in-depth articles and a huge community of coders",
