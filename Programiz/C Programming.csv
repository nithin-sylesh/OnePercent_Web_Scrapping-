String Literals$$$Table of Contents,,"In this tutorial, you will learn about variables and rules for naming a variable. You will also learn about different literals in C programming and how to create constants.|||In programming, a variable is a container (storage area) to hold data.|||To indicate the storage area, each variable should be given a unique name (identifier). Variable names are just the symbolic representation of a memory location. For example:|||Here, playerScore is a variable of int type. Here, the variable is assigned an integer value 95.|||The value of a variable can be changed, hence the name variable.|||Note: You should always try to give meaningful names to variables. For example: firstName is a better variable name than fn.|||C is a strongly typed language. This means that the variable type cannot be changed once it is declared. For example:|||Here, the type of number variable is int. You cannot assign a floating-point (decimal) value 5.5 to this variable. Also, you cannot redefine the data type of the variable to double. By the way, to store the decimal values in C, you need to declare its type to either double or float.|||Visit this page to learn more about different types of data a variable can store.|||Literals are data used for representing fixed values. They can be used directly in the code. For example: 1, 2.5, 'c' etc.|||Here, 1, 2.5 and 'c' are literals. Why? You cannot assign different values to these terms.|||An integer is a numeric literal(associated with numbers) without any fractional or exponential part. There are three types of integer literals in C programming:||||||For example:|||In C programming, octal starts with a 0, and hexadecimal starts with a 0x.|||A floating-point literal is a numeric literal that has either a fractional form or an exponent form. For example:|||Note: E-5 = 10-5|||A character literal is created by enclosing a single character inside single quotation marks. For example: 'a', 'm', 'F', '2', '}' etc.|||Sometimes, it is necessary to use characters that cannot be typed or has special meaning in C programming. For example: newline(enter), tab, question mark etc.|||In order to use these characters, escape sequences are used.|||For example: \n is used for a newline. The backslash \ causes escape from the normal way the characters are handled by the compiler.|||A string literal is a sequence of characters enclosed in double-quote marks. For example:|||If you want to define a variable whose value cannot be changed, you can use the const keyword. This will create a constant.

This determines the type and size of data associated with variables. For example,|||Here, myVar is a variable of int (integer) type. The size of int is 4 bytes.|||Here's a table containing commonly used types in C programming for quick access.|||Integers are whole numbers that can have both zero, positive and negative values but no decimal values. For example, 0, -5, 10|||We can use int for declaring an integer variable.|||Here, id is a variable of type integer.|||You can declare multiple variables at once in C programming. For example,|||The size of int is usually 4 bytes (32 bits). And, it can take 232 distinct states from -2147483648 to 2147483647.|||float and double are used to hold real numbers.|||In C, floating-point numbers can also be represented in exponential. For example,||||||What's the difference between float and double?|||The size of float (single precision float data type) is 4 bytes. And the size of double (double precision float data type) is 8 bytes.|||Keyword char is used for declaring character type variables. For example,|||The size of the character variable is 1 byte.|||void is an incomplete type. It means ""nothing"" or ""no type"". You can think of void as absent.|||For example, if a function is not returning anything, its return type should be void.|||Note that, you cannot create variables of void type.|||If you need to use a large number, you can use a type specifier long. Here's how:|||Here variables a and b can store integer values. And, c can store a floating-point number.|||If you are sure, only a small integer ([−32,767, +32,767] range) will be used, you can use short.|||You can always check the size of a variable using the sizeof() operator.|||In C, signed and unsigned are type modifiers. You can alter the data storage of a data type by using them:|||For example,|||Here, the variables x and num can hold only zero and positive values because we have used the unsigned modifier.|||Considering the size of int is 4 bytes, variable y can hold values from -231 to 231-1, whereas variable x can hold values from 0 to 232-1.|||Data types that are derived from fundamental data types are derived types.

It can be used for a wide range of applications from Operating systems like Windows and iOS to software that is used to create 3D movies.|||To get started with C programming, visit our C Tutorials.|||C is a procedural language. This means instructions in the C program are executed step by step.|||If you are interested to know how procedural language is different from other forms of programming language like object-oriented, visit differences between procedural and object-oriented languages.|||C programming allows programmers to directly manipulate computer hardware. This is one of the reasons why C programming is faster in processing than other new languages like Java, Python, etc.|||""Write once, compile everywhere"". This means we can write a standard C program in one system (e.g. Windows) and compile it in another system (e.g. Mac OS) without any change.|||C provides various standard libraries. Standard libraries are a section of C code that helps to perform different tasks.|||For example, suppose you need to display something on the screen, you can include stdio.h library that allows you to use printf() function.|||C is a statically types language. This means the type of a variable is checked during the compile time but not in the run-time. Statically typed languages are faster than dynamically typed language in general.|||Despite being old, C is used in a variety of applications. For example,|||If you don't know C, you don't know what you are doing as a programmer. Sure, your application works fine and all. But, if you can't say why while (*s++ = *p++); copies a string, you're programming on a superstition. (Joel Spolsky's words, not mine).|||If you know C, you will not only know how your program works but, you will be able to create a mental model of how a computer works (including memory management and allocation).|||Almost all high-level programming languages like Java, Python, Javascript, etc can interface with C programming. Doesn't matter if the person you are talking with doesn't know C, you can still convey your programming ideas in a way they can understand.|||If you know C, you can contribute to large open-source projects that impact hundreds of millions of people. Some of the larger open source projects where C programming is used are Linux, Kernel, Interpreter, Python, SQLite Database, etc.|||A lot of popular programming languages are based on C (and C++, considered superset of C programming with OOP features). Hence, if you know C and C++, you will not have any problem switching to another language.||||||And also, languages like Java and C# are related to C and C++. And, the syntax of Javascript and PHP is similar to C.|||Best practices are informal rules which can improve quality and decrease the development time of the software.|||Some of the practices mentioned here are valid for all programming languages. However, some are valid only for C programming.|||The number of spaces you use in the program doesn't matter in C. However, you shouldn't use a different number of spaces at different places. Also, proper spacing makes the code easier to understand.|||What's wrong with the following code?|||Actually, the code is perfectly valid. But, wouldn't this be better:|||The goal here is to write code that your fellow programmers can understand.|||Give a proper name to variables and functions and be consistent with it. For example,|||Here, a and b are two variables. But, it doesn't specify what they represent. However, if you choose names like:|||This will be better to understand.|||Comments are part of codes that the compiler ignores. They can be used to explain what you are trying to achieve in your program. This helps fellow programmers to understand the code.|||We at Programiz think C is a terrific language to learn.|||For beginners, it helps to understand the working of programs and computers in general. And, for professionals, it will certainly help you brush up on programming basics.","Embedded Systems $$$Operating System - Windows, Linux, OSX, Android, iOS$$$Databases - PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, MS SQL Server$$$Other Uses - Network drivers, Compilers, Print spoolers$$$What is C Programming?$$$Features of C$$$Reasons to learn C$$$How to learn in C?$$$Best Practice$$$Final Words",,
